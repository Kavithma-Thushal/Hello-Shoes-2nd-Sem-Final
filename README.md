# Hello Shoes (PVT) LTD. 👟

The Hello Shoes (PVT) LTD. repositories comprise the comprehensive Shoe Shop Management System. The frontend repository,
built with modern web technologies, delivers an engaging and intuitive interface for customers to explore the shoe
catalog, place orders, and manage their accounts, while also providing administrative features for inventory management,
order processing, and sales data analysis. This frontend pairs seamlessly with the backend repository, which is
implemented using Spring Boot. The backend offers robust RESTful APIs that handle inventory management, order
processing, customer management, and authentication. Leveraging Spring Boot's powerful features, such as dependency
injection and JPA, it ensures efficient and scalable operations, supporting the frontend with a strong foundation for a
smooth and responsive shoe shopping experience.
